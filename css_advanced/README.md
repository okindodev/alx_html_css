# The project
This project is a webpage built from scratch from a designer file from figma. https://www.figma.com/design/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage?node-id=3558-0&t=FOOE7v6xa6bJK0Aa-0.

## Scope
The skeleton of the webpage is a wireframe beginning with some purely HTML code which is later styled with some CSS.
### Getting started
HTML Advanced
The HTML Advanced was ideally supposed to be a project to be completed by you but to give you time to focus on the CSS part, you are provided with some HTML code for this project.
Go through it to understand what is expected of you


Objectives!
In this and coming project, you will implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file.
For this first project, you will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.
This designer file will be available on Figma - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:
Page in Figma
fig file
And “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

Important notes with Figma:
if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
some values are in float - feel free to round them
Header
Let’s start by the top: the header
Here the wireframe of it:

Create the HTML skeleton (html, head, body, etc.)
In the body, add an header tag
Inside this header:
Add a link element with an image inside
Add a block of 3 link elements
Banner
Now, the banner under the header:

Under the header, add a main element with inside it, a section element.
In this section element, add:
A block with inside it:
An heading tag (don’t forget to use the correct heading value)
A text element
A button tag
Another block with inside it:
Another heading tag (same, be careful about which one you are using)
A block containing 4 blocks - each block with inside:
An image
An heading tag
A text
Quote
Under the banner, we will add the quote block:

The quote section is inside the main:
Create a new section for the quote
Inside it, add a block containing:
An image
Another block with inside:
A quote tag
An author quote
A text
Videos
Let’s now add the videos list:

New section with inside it:
An heading tag
A block containing the 4 video block - each of them are composed with:
An image
An heading
A text
A block for the author:
A image
An heading
A block for the rating:
A block of images (one star = one image)
A text
Membership
Membership section is similar as the videos list:

After the videos list section, add a new section containing:
An heading
A block with inside 4 block item - each block defined with:
An image
An heading
A text
A button
FAQ
The FAQ section is ending the page before the footer:

Add a section for the FAQ with inside it:
A block that contains 2 “row block”
Each “row block” contains 2 “item block”
Each “item block” is composed of:
An heading
A text
Footer
And… the footer!

After the last section, outside of the main, add a footer:
A global block (used later for centering the footer content), inside this block:
A “row block” with:
An image
A block with inside:
Images with link
A text
And… that’s it for the moment - the result should not be shiny, don’t worry, CSS is coming…
Below is the sample code written for this project. Go through it and make sure everything is in line with the requirements of the HTML Advanced tasks and get ready for the CSS Advanced task where you will write CSS code to style this HTML.


NB: If you need any of the assets (logos, other images), you can export them from the figma file and use them accordingly.
